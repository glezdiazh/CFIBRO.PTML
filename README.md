# Abstract
Cystic Fibrosis (CF) is an autosomal recessive genetic disorder caused by mutations in the CFTR gene, leading to dysfunctional chloride and other ion transport across the apical cell membrane of epithelial cells lining the airways, GI tract, sweat duct, and other tissues. This results in thick mucus secretions and chronic pulmonary infections. Traditional treatment approaches rely on antibiotic susceptibility testing (AST), which often fails to correlate with clinical outcomes due to the complex and multifactorial nature of CF infections.  Here, we present a novel Artificial Intelligence (AI) model to predict clinical outcomes in cystic fibrosis (CF) patients. This AI model could represent the basis for developing more personalized and effective treatment strategies in CF care.



# Personal Data Protection

All data management and analysis were in compliance with the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR). GDPR defines pseudonymization in Article 4 (5) as: 'the processing of personal data in such a way that they can no longer be attributed to a data subject without the use of additional information, provided that such additional information is kept separately and is subject to technical and organizational measures intended to ensure that the personal data are not attributed to an identified or identifiable natural person'. In general terms, pseudonymization aims at protecting personal data by hiding the identity of individuals (data subjects) in a data set, for example by replacing one or more personal data identifiers with so-called pseudonyms and by adequately protecting the link between the pseudonyms and the initial identifiers. Consequently, all patient data was pseudonymized by the team of the Biocruces Foundation by using an internal code to identify the patients. These codes and the identities of patients were never shared with the other researchers in this paper or the public in general.
